# Read the following very carefully

## Step-up Flutter - Take home challenge

Recreating designs, UI mockups or just ideas is first responsibility of any mobile application developer.
This challenge requires you recreate the given designs in a Flutter app. 

### Instructions

The idea is to give you confidence that how convenient it is to recreate the designs on Flutter of everyday apps we use.

- In the given folder named "screens" you will find 30 screenshots of different mobile applications. 
- You have to select ***any 2*** from these.
- You will then create a Flutter app in which you will recreate UI of these 2 selected screens.
- Host your code on GitHub

When desiging your screens you may use any placholder images for the dynamic content such as videos or photos. If you are unable to find exact fonts and icons for your respective screens, you may use anything similar looking.
